## 1. Building Blocks

A collection of foundational components used in designing distributed systems. Each topic explores design principles, trade-offs, and typical use cases.

- **Domain Name System (DNS)** ‚Äì Maps domain names to IP addresses for service discovery.
- **Load Balancers** ‚Äì Distribute traffic across servers to ensure high availability.
- **Databases** ‚Äì Store and manage structured data with consistency guarantees.
- **Key-Value Store** ‚Äì Fast storage system for simple key-value data access.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** ‚Äì Serves static content from edge locations to reduce latency.
- **Sequencer** ‚Äì Provides a consistent global order of events or operations.
- **Service Monitoring** ‚Äì Observes system health through metrics and alerts.
- **Distributed Caching** ‚Äì Stores frequently accessed data in-memory across nodes.
- **Distributed Messaging Queue** ‚Äì Enables asynchronous communication between services.
- **Publish-Subscribe System** ‚Äì Allows message broadcasting to multiple subscribers.
- **Rate Limiter** ‚Äì Restricts request rate to protect systems from overload.
- **Blob Store** ‚Äì Stores large binary files like images, videos, or backups.
- **Distributed Search** ‚Äì Scalable search over large datasets using distributed indexing.
- **Distributed Logging** ‚Äì Centralizes logs from multiple sources for analysis.
- **Distributed Task Scheduling** ‚Äì Manages background jobs across multiple nodes.
- **Sharded Counters** ‚Äì Splits counting logic to scale under high load.
