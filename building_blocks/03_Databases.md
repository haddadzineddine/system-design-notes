## Databases

Databases are fundamental for storing, retrieving, and modifying data reliably in distributed systems.

#### Core Concepts:
- **Database Types:** Relational (SQL) vs Non-relational (NoSQL)
- **Replication:** Copies data across servers for fault tolerance and read scaling.
- **Partitioning (Sharding):** Splits data across multiple nodes for write scaling.
- **Consistency Models:** Balancing between strong and eventual consistency depending on use case.
