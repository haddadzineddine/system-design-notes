## Sequencer

A sequencer generates unique, ordered IDs in distributed systems, maintaining causality and avoiding collisions.

#### Approaches:
- **Centralized Sequencer:** Single authority issues IDs.
- **Timestamp-based IDs:** Use time components (e.g., Twitter Snowflake).
- **UUIDs:** Universally unique but not necessarily ordered.
