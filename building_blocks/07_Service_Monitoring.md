## Service Monitoring

Monitoring systems collect metrics and logs to analyze system health and detect failures early.

#### Components:
- **Server-side Monitoring:** CPU, memory, latency, error rates.
- **Client-side Monitoring:** User experience and frontend errors.
- **Alerting Systems:** Notify teams of anomalies.
