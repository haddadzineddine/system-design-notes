## Content Delivery Network (CDN)

CDNs cache and serve content (like videos, images, and web pages) from servers close to users to reduce latency and bandwidth use.

#### Design Highlights:
- **Edge Caching:** Stores content geographically closer to end-users.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Mechanisms to refresh stale content.
- **Load Distribution:** Balances traffic across edge servers.
- **DDoS Mitigation:** Protects origin servers by absorbing traffic at edges.
